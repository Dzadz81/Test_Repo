You remain the same
You won't fade
You are constant
And consistent
Faithful and true
All my days
By Your grace
You watch over what You spoken
'Cause that's what You do
You are the yes and amen
You're the end and my beginning
My defender and friend
Through it all, I will stay on the rock
When it feels that I am sinking
I remember who You are
All that is will be forgotten
Still You remain, still You remain
In my valleys or my mountain
You'll be the same, You never change
